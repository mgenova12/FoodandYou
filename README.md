# Food & You

Food & You is an app that allows users to track their nutrional intake. It implements USDA's [API] to give accurate nutrional information.

# Motivation

People spend hundreds of dollars on groceries every month, but don’t have a great understanding of how much they’re actually consuming and in what quantities. This app allows users to feed data about their purchases and give them a nutrional break down of what they ate. It also records the foods you eat and gives you recommendations. 

# Tech

Food & You uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Ruby on Rails] - Server-side web application framework written in Ruby
* [VueJS] - The Progressive JavaScript Framework
* [Bootstap] - The most popular HTML, CSS, and JS library in the world
* [PostgreSQL] - Powerful, open source object-relational database system
* [Bcrypt] -  A password hashing function
* [Vue Select] - A native Vue.js select component
* [Paper Clip] - Easy file attachment library for ActiveRecord
* [High charts] - Interactive JavaScript charts
* [Full Calendar] - Open source JavaScript jQuery plugin for event calendars
